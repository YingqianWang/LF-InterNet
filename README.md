#### News: We recommend our newly-released repository [*BasicLFSR*](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR) for the implementation of our LF-InterNet. [*BasicLFSR*](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR) is an open-source and easy-to-use toolbox for LF image SR. A number of milestone methods have been implemented (retrained) in a unified framework in [*BasicLFSR*](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR).

## Codes and Models:

### Requirement:
* PyTorch 1.3.0, torchvision 0.4.1. The code is tested with python=3.7, cuda=9.0.
* Matlab (For training/test data generation and performance evaluation)

### Test:
* Download the test sets and unzip them to `./data`. Here, we provide a demo test set (<a href="https://wyqdatabase.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data_demo.zip">data_demo.zip</a>) which only includes one test scene, and we also provide the full test set on [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LfopBUF_aKvfvUhSqA2Cew) (Key: NUDT) which is used in our paper.
* Download our pretrained models (<a href="https://wyqdatabase.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/log.zip">log.zip</a>) and unzip them to `./log`.
* Run `GenerateDataForTest.m` to generate test data.
* Run `test.py` to perform a demo inference. Note that, the selected pretrained model should match the generated input data and the preset network architecture. Initial results (`.mat` files) will be saved to `./results`.
* Run `evaluation.m` to calculate PSNR and SSIM scores and transform initial results (`.mat` files) into `.png` images.

### Train:
Please switch to [*LF-InterNet_train*](https://github.com/YingqianWang/LF-InterNet/tree/LF-InterNet_train) for details.
